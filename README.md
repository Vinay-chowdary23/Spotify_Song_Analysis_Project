## Spotify Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes a Spotify dataset to gain insights about songs, artists, and genres using Python.

The main goal was to explore patterns in song popularity, energy, danceability, and duration, and visualize them using different graphs.

Through this project, I strengthened my skills in data analysis, cleaning, and visualization.

## Dataset

File name: dataset.csv

Description: The dataset includes details about songs such as track name, artists, genre, popularity, and various audio features like danceability, energy, loudness, and duration.

Source: Spotify Songs Dataset (Publicly Available for Educational Use)





## Project Objectives

❖ Load and clean the dataset (handle unnecessary columns)

❖ Find the most popular songs and artists

❖ Analyze energy, danceability, and loudness correlation

❖ Identify top-performing genres based on popularity

❖ Visualize duration distribution and summarize findings

## Tools & Libraries Used

✦ Python

✦ Pandas

✦ NumPy

✦ Matplotlib

✦ Seaborn

## Visual Outputs
All output images are saved inside the [outputs](./outputs) folder.

- [Duration Histogram](./outputs/histplot.png)
- [Final Summary Output](./outputs/Final_summary_output.png)

## Key Findings

• Pop and Dance Pop are the most popular genres

• There is a strong positive correlation between danceability and energy

• The average song duration is around 3.5 minutes

• Energy and loudness are positively related

• Artists with higher popularity tend to maintain consistent engagement metrics
